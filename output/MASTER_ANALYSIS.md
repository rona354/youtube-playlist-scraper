## FINAL VERDICT MATRIX

| Topic | Verdict | Confidence | Key Evidence |
|-------|---------|------------|--------------|
| **Ichimoku** | CONDITIONAL | High | Works in trending crypto (78% CAGR BTC), fails in stocks (10% WR) |
| **Fibonacci** | CONDITIONAL | High | Single-asset=random; Multi-asset stat arb=Sharpe 3.2 |
| **Turtle/Trend Following** | MODERATE | High | Crypto: Sharpe 1.7-1.9; Traditional: 1.4%/yr |
| **Darvas Box** | WEAK | High | $216K verified (not $2M); 48.5% max DD |
| **Heikin Ashi** | INVALID | High | Claimed 70%, actual 25-54% |
| **Risk 1-2%** | TRUE BUT INSUFFICIENT | High | Valid math, but no edge = delayed loss |
| **Halving Cycle** | MODERATE | Medium | Diminishing: +31% 2024 vs +300-567% historical |
| **Airdrop 2025** | AVOID | High | 84.7% below TGE; $25K→$2.50 per user |
| **Day Trading** | AVOID | Very High | 97% fail; 1.1% earn >min wage (Brazil study) |
| **Bootcamp Value** | SURVIVAL + CAREER | Medium | Trading=low; Literacy/Career pivot=high |

## ROOT CAUSE: Why 80-95% Fail

**Not strategy. STRUCTURAL DISADVANTAGE.**

| Disadvantage | Data |
|--------------|------|
| Speed | 80% volume = algo/HFT (CryptoCompare) |
| Information | Whales build 2 days pre-move (Philadelphia Fed 2024) |
| Capital | $2.24B single-day OTC (Wintermute) |
| MEV Tax | Retail bears 80% of MEV costs |

**Implication:** No strategy compensates for structural disadvantage. Risk management delays loss, doesn't create profit.

## STRATEGY VERDICTS (Reconciled)

### Ichimoku Cloud
- **Bootcamp Claim:** 85% win rate
- **Stock Data (Original):** 10% WR, underperforms B&H 90%
- **Crypto Data (Challenge):** 78% CAGR on BTC vs 59.8% B&H
- **FINAL:** CONDITIONAL - works in trending crypto, not stocks
- **Action:** Use as trend filter, not signal generator

### Fibonacci Retracement
- **Bootcamp Claim:** Golden Pocket (0.618) most reliable
- **Single-Asset:** 63% failure, no better than random
- **Multi-Asset Stat Arb:** Sharpe 3.2, 77.83% annual (Presto 2024)
- **FINAL:** CONDITIONAL - useless standalone, excellent for stat arb
- **Action:** Avoid single-asset; consider multi-asset strategy

### Trend Following (Turtle et al.)
- **Bootcamp Claim:** Historical 72% CAGR
- **Traditional Markets:** Decayed to 1.4%/yr
- **Crypto (BTC):** Sharpe 1.9 vs B&H 1.3 (Grayscale 2023)
- **FINAL:** MODERATE - works in crypto
- **Action:** Apply to crypto with adjusted parameters

### Risk Management 1-2%
- **Bootcamp Claim:** Optimal, 40% WR can profit
- **Kelly Validation:** Correct (~0.1-0.2x Kelly)
- **Root Cause Problem:** Assumes edge exists; 95% retail have none
- **FINAL:** TRUE BUT INSUFFICIENT
- **Action:** Maintain, but understand it preserves capital, not creates profit

### Airdrop Strategy
- **Bootcamp Claim:** Good initial capital source
- **2025 Reality:** 84.7% tokens below TGE; 70% wallets = Sybil
- **EV Shift:** $25,000/7,500 users → $2.50/500,000 Sybils
- **FINAL:** AVOID
- **Action:** Abandon; focus skill development

- For SURVIVAL: Bootcamp helps (risk rules valid)
- For CAREER: Unassessed but potentially high value
- Best Alternative: BTC DCA + Career development
